# password-generator

This is a basic password generator that allows a user to select what character types they would like to have in their password, how many characters they would like to have, and then allow them to copy it to their clipboard. Users must select at least one character type, otherwise they will receive an error message. The slider has a range from 8 - 128. The number of characters must be selected using the slider.
